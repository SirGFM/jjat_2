        <h1> JJAT+ </h1>
        <h1 class="subtitle"> WIP title. It shall be changed until the game's release. </h1>


        <h2> About the game </h2>

        <p> "JJAT+" is a co-op game in which two robots must help each other
        through their adventure. Play it with a friend or try to control both
        characters at once. </p>


        <h2> Launching the game </h2>

        <p> The preferred way to download and launch the game is through
        <a href="https://itch.io/app">itch</a>, the itch.io app.</p>

        <p> The app automatically manages <strong>updating</strong> the game and
        has built-in <strong>launch options</strong>. </p>

        <p> If you manually downloaded the game, there are a few ways to easily
        launch the game in one of the specified modes: </p>

        <h3> Windows </h3>

        <p> There are three batch scripts that handle launching the game: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> Single_Player_Mode.bat: Launch the game in single player mode.
                </li>
            <li> Two_Players_Mode.bat: Launch the game in two players mode.
                </li>
            <li> Synchronous_Single_Player_Mode.bat: Launch the game in
            synchronous single player mode. </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Simply double-click the desired script. </p>

        <h3> Linux </h3>

        <p> There's a single script used to launch the game,
        <tt>launch.sh</tt>. Execute that script with one of the following
        arguments: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> --single-player-mode | -1p: Launch the game in single player
            mode. </li>
            <li> --two-player-mode | -2p: Launch the game in two players mode.
                </li>
            <li> --synchronous-single-player-mode | -s1p: Launch the game in
            synchronous single player mode. </li>
        </ul>


        <h2> How to play </h2>

        <h3> Controls </h3>

        <p> Currently, each character is assigned four actions: move left, move
        right, jump and action. </p>

        <p> The following schemes are present, and accessible from the launch
        game menu (if launching from the itch.io app): </p>

        <p> Although not yet implemented, the pause action is mapped to the
        first two gamepad's pause button (if connected) and to the Escape key.
            </p>

        <h4> Single player mode </h4>

        <p> Control both characters at once. If using a keyboard (it must have
        two analog sticks and four should buttons), the left half of the
        controller controls Red, while the right half controls Blue. </p>

        <p> On the keyboard, Red is controlled with the WASD (or ZQSD) keys and
        Blue is controlled with the arrow keys </p>

        <h4> About custom controls </h4>

        <p> The game already supports rebind-able controls. Each of the modes
        described above simply start the game with a different mapping. However,
        there's still no in-game interface for configuring it. Also, creating a
        new mapping is quite cumbersome. </p>

        <p> If none of the default configurations work for you, do get in
        contact and we will figure something out! </p>

        <h3> The red robot </h3>

        <p> The red robot is an offensive unit. It has more mobility and may use
        its sword to attack enemies or reflect energy projectiles. </p>

        <p> Although the unit's official name is "CRL-000", it's usually simply
        referred as "Red". </p>

        <h3> The blue robot </h3>

        <p> The blue robot is a technical unit. It has a teleport gun, which may
        target either other entities (switching places with them) or surfaces,
        teleporting the robot to the targeted place. </p>

        <p> Although the unit's official name is "RFS-001", it's usually simply
        referred as "Blue". </p>

        <h3> Entities interaction </h3>

        <p> Entities in this world are usually able to carry each other
        effortlessly, regardless of their apparent weights. </p>

        <p> However, some may be armed with horns, or even weapons. Pay
        attention! </p>

        <h2> About the current title </h2>

        <p> Back in 2015, I took part of the Global Game Jam and made a small
        prototype in which a player must control two characters at once. </p>

        <p> That prototype was the starting point for a game I made on that
        same year called <a href="https://gfm.itch.io/jjat">JJAT</a>.
        However, that game feels incomplete, and is too harsh. </p>

        <p> This game is meant to be a "spiritual successor" for JJAT. Hence why
        it's currently being called "JJAT+". </p>

        <p> Eventually, the game will be given a proper title. But, until then,
        I'll keep calling it "JJAT+" (or, sometime "JJAT 2"). </p>
