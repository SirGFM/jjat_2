        <h1> JJAT+ </h1>
        <h1 class="subtitle"> WIP title. It shall be changed until the game's release. </h1>


        <h2> About the game </h2>

        <p> "JJAT+" is a co-op game in which two robots must help each other
        through their adventure. Play it with a friend or try to control both
        characters at once. </p>


        <h2> How to play (and characters) </h2>

        <h3> The red robot </h3>

        <p> The red robot is an offensive unit. It has more mobility and may use
        its sword to attack enemies or reflect energy projectiles. </p>

        <p> Although the unit's official name is "CRL-000", it's usually simply
        referred as "Red". </p>

        <div class="image-list">
            <div class="image-box">
                <img class="nearest-neighbor centered" src="img/swordy_run.gif"> </img>
                <p class="subtitle"> "Red" is quite fast! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img class="nearest-neighbor centered" src="img/swordy_jump.gif"> </img>
                <p class="subtitle"> It also may jump really high! </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3> The blue robot (RFS-000) </h3>

        <p> The blue robot is a technical unit. It has a teleport gun, which may
        target either other entities (switching places with them) or surfaces,
        teleporting the robot to the targeted place. </p>

        <p> Although the unit's official name is "RFS-000", it's usually simply
        referred as "Blue". </p>

        <div class="image-list">
            <div class="image-box">
                <img class="nearest-neighbor centered" src="img/gunny_run.gif"> </img>
                <p class="subtitle"> "Blue" is quite slower than "Red" </p>
            </div>
            <div class="image-box">
                <img class="nearest-neighbor centered" src="img/gunny_jump.gif"> </img>
                <p class="subtitle"> Its jump is also lower... </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3> Entities interaction </h3>

        <p> Entities in this world are usually able to carry each other
        effortlessly, regardless of their apparent weights. </p>

        <p> However, some may be armed with spikes, or even weapons. Pay
        attention! </p>


        <h2> About the current title </h2>

        <p> Back in 2015, I took part of the Global Game Jam and made a small
        prototype in which a player must control two characters at once. </p>

        <p> That prototype was the starting point for a game I made on that
        same year called <a href="https://gfm.itch.io/jjat">JJAT</a>.
        However, that game feels incomplete, and is too harsh. </p>

        <p> This game is meant to be a "spiritual sucessor" for JJAT. Hence why
        it's currently being called "JJAT+". </p>

        <p> Eventually, the game will be given a proper title. But, until then,
        I'll keep calling it "JJAT+" (or, sometime "JJAT 2"). </p>
