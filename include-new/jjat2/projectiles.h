 * Manages all projectiles.

 * Projectiles represents every entity without logic. It may be used both for
 * "regular" projectiles (bullet, hitbox etc) and for long-lived "dumb" objects
 * (trigger, power-up etc), which only has logic on collision. For that reason,
 * projectiles are implemented using gfmGroup.
